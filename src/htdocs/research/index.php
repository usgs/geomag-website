      Research projects within the USGS Geomagnetism Program are targeted for
      societal relevance, especially for space-weather hazard science. Consistent
      with the goals and issues addressed in the USGS Natural Hazards Strategic
      Plan, these research projects support pursuit of fundamental understanding of
      geomagnetic storms and related phenomena, development of geomagnetic products
      needed for assessments and real-time situational awareness, informed operation
      of the Program's magnetic-observatory network. Geomagnetism Program research
      staff provide outside advice, national and international leadership, and write
      educational articles about geomagnetic and space-weather hazards.

      Fundamental research within the USGS Geomagnetism Program is concentrated on
      the analysis of the information content of magnetic-field time series acquired
      at ground-base magnetic observatories. Methods include formal time-series and
      statistical analysis, and data assimilation for physics-based models of the
      magnetosphere and ionosphere. Recent work has included the analysis of the
      symmetry (and asymmetry) of low-latitude ground-level magnetic disturbance
      during individual magnetic storms; long-term secular change in geomagnetic
      disturbance and its correlational relationship with sunspots and
      interplanetary solar wind; secular change in geomagnetic activity and global
      climate change; solar-quiet geomagnetic variation and periodic geomagnetic
      tides; extreme-geophysical-event analysis; and investigation of claims that
      earthquakes are sometimes preceded by magnetic precursory signals.

      Guided by fundamental understanding, geomagnetic products are developed to
      meet the needs of the space-weather community for hazard assessments and
      real-time situational awareness. Recent work has concentrated on the
      development of new and improved summary-index measures of global magnetic
      disturbance related to the magnetospheric ring current and the auroral
      electrojet, needed for validating and as input for physics-based models of the
      space environment; and localized measures of magnetic disturbance and
      geomagnetically-induced currents needed by the electric power-grid industry.
      The Geomagnetism Program recently initiated a project for estimating
      geomagnetically-induced currents in the lithosphere in order to assess and
      mitigate hazards for the power-grid industry.
