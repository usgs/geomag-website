  Research projects within the USGS Geomagnetism Program are targeted for
  societal relevance, especially for space-weather hazard science. Consistent
  with the goals and issues addressed in the USGS Natural Hazards Strategic
  Plan, these research projects support pursuit of fundamental understanding of
  geomagnetic storms and related phenomena, development of geomagnetic products
  needed for assessments and real-time situational awareness, informed operation
  of the Program's magnetic-observatory network. Geomagnetism Program research
  staff provide outside advice, national and international leadership, and write
  educational articles about geomagnetic and space-weather hazards.

  Fundamental research within the USGS Geomagnetism Program is concentrated on
  the analysis of the information content of magnetic-field time series acquired
  at ground-base magnetic observatories. Methods include formal time-series and
  statistical analysis, and data assimilation for physics-based models of the
  magnetosphere and ionosphere. Recent work has included the analysis of the
  symmetry (and asymmetry) of low-latitude ground-level magnetic disturbance
  during individual magnetic storms; long-term secular change in geomagnetic
  disturbance and its correlational relationship with sunspots and
  interplanetary solar wind; secular change in geomagnetic activity and global
  climate change; solar-quiet geomagnetic variation and periodic geomagnetic
  tides; extreme-geophysical-event analysis; and investigation of claims that
  earthquakes are sometimes preceded by magnetic precursory signals.

  Guided by fundamental understanding, geomagnetic products are developed to
  meet the needs of the space-weather community for hazard assessments and
  real-time situational awareness. Recent work has concentrated on the
  development of new and improved summary-index measures of global magnetic
  disturbance related to the magnetospheric ring current and the auroral
  electrojet, needed for validating and as input for physics-based models of the
  space environment; and localized measures of magnetic disturbance and
  geomagnetically-induced currents needed by the electric power-grid industry.
  The Geomagnetism Program recently initiated a project for estimating
  geomagnetically-induced currents in the lithosphere in order to assess and
  mitigate hazards for the power-grid industry.
