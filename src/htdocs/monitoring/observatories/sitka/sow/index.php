<h2>Demolition and Removal of a Seismic Vault at Sitka Magnetic Observatory</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  The United States Geological Survey maintains a geomagnetic observatory in
  Sitka, Alaska. This observatory is tasked with continually monitoring the
  magnetic field of the earth.

<p>
  The US Geological Survey (USGS) is preparing an Environmental Assessment to
  disclose the potential effects of removing a concrete structure within the
  boundary of the Geomagnetic Observatory on Geodetic Way in Sitka.
</p>
<p>
  The purpose of this website is to inform you about the project and to provide
  an opportunity to comment on the Proposed Action as part of the scoping phase
  of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation process.  This
  website details the demolition and removal of the underground concrete
  structure (a seismic vault) at the Sitka Magnetic Observatory site.
</p>

<h3>Description of Project</h3>
<p>
  The USGS proposes to demolish and remove a buried concrete structure (seismic
  vault) at the USGS Magnetic Observatory located at 500 Geodetic Way in Sitka,
  Alaska.  The project is located in the SE corner of a 117-acre Federal
  Withdrawal originally used as an experimental agriculture station from
  approximately 1898 until 1931, and then as a magnetic and seismic monitoring
  station/observatory, managed by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey until 1973,
  when it became part of the USGS Geomagnetic Program. The withdrawn area
  includes seven structures (six wood framed buildings and the seismic vault)
  built in 1940 and currently in use by various agencies including the National
  Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), USGS, and the University
  of Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service. NOAA currently operates seismic
  recording equipment in the vault and plans to construct a smaller structure to
  house their equipment on the site.
</p>
<p>
  A Comprehensive Condition Assessment completed by CTA Architects Engineers in
  2009, found the vault to be in poor condition, with visible cracks in the
  floor, ceiling, ceiling concrete beams, and walls.  A concrete roof structure
  has collapsed into a 36” space between two concrete walls, creating a
  hazardous situation.  The report recommended that the building be demolished.
</p>

<p>
  The project site is approximately 600 feet from a residential neighborhood to
  the south (Merrill Street) and 400-500 feet from the Sitka National Cemetery
  to the east.  Public vehicular access to the area is restricted by a key-coded
  gate across Geodetic Way. Pedestrian access from the surrounding properties is
  discouraged but not blocked.
</p>

<p>
  As proposed, demolition of the seismic vault would occur during the summer of
  2010.  A 100-foot long by 15-foot wide equipment access road to the vault from
  the existing driveway would be constructed.  The access route is relatively
  level and only minor clearing and excavation would be required.  An area
  adjacent to the access road would be cleared to allow for stockpiling of soil
  for rehabilitation of the site.  All demolition debris would be removed to an
  approved municipal disposal area or as directed by the City and Borough of
  Sitka.

<p>
  Two concrete “piers” located within the vault would be protected and retained
  for future use (Figures 2 and 3).  All remaining concrete within the vault
  would be removed and the site recontoured using stockpiled soil.  To the
  extent practicable, excavation would only occur within the footprint of the
  seismic vault to prevent disturbance to the surrounding area.  Implementation
  of Best Management Practices for retaining sediment and runoff within the
  excavated area would be required.

<h3>Purpose and Need for Action</h3>
<p>
  The purpose and need for the proposed action is to remove an unsafe structure
  from the USGS Geomagnetic Observatory site in Sitka, Alaska while minimizing
  disturbance to natural resources in the area and negative effects to the
  historic nature of the site.  The structure is currently in use as a NOAA
  mission-critical seismic recording station but is an unsafe condition both for
  its current users and for persons using the surface above the structure.
</p>

<h3>Decision to be Made</h3>
<p>
  Based on the analysis in the Environmental Assessment, the USGS Responsible
  Official will determine if the preferred alternative will have a significant
  impact on the quality of the human environment.  If there is no significant
  impact, the USGS will issue a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) and
  make a final decision regarding whether or not to proceed with the project on
  the basis of agency mission, legal mandates and public comment on the draft
  EA.
</p>
<p>
  If the Responsible Official determines that there may be a significant impact,
  the Official may choose to not proceed with the project or to prepare
  Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
</p>

<h3>Legal Mandates</h3>
<p>
  USGS projects are required to comply with Federal, State and Local substantive
  and procedural requirements, and with any applicable Federal, State and Local
  requirements or Executive Orders that are more stringent than those listed in
  the USGS Manual (USGS, 2002, Chapter 1, Section 1.A(2)).
</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>
  We encourage you to comment on this action and identify issues which may be of
  concern to you.  Please try to be specific when identifying a concern.
</p>
<p>
  The project will also be discussed at the April meeting of the Sitka Historic
  Preservation Commission which is open to the public.  The meeting will be held
  on Wednesday, April 7th, and the USGS Seismic Bunker Project is on the agenda.
  This meeting will only be a brief on the intent of the project.  The
  Commission awaits the EA/Historic report for review and recommendation.
  Commission meeting minutes will be made available on the City and Borough of
  Sitka's website shortly thereafter.
