<p>
  Model CP-1 primarily represents the Coastal Plain geophysical province
  around South Carolina, but extends northward through North Carolina,
  Virginia, and into western Maryland. Note that Fernberg's tabulated
  resistivities differ from his figures; models posted by USGS have been
  corrected to match the body of his report. [Fernberg, EPRI 2012]
