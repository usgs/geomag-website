<p>
  Model IP-1 represents generally the eastern Interior Plains geophysical
  province. Although a vast (sub)province, the model should be considered
  typical of the eastern portion of North Dakota only. Note that Fernberg's
  tabulated resistivities differ from his figures; models posted by USGS have
  been corrected to match the body of his report. [Fernberg, EPRI 2012]
