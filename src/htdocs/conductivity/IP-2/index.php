<p>
  Model IP-2 is provided primarily to represent the North American
  Conductivity Anomaly (NACP), a narrow region of low resistivity extending
  across western South and North Dakota, and north into Canada along the
  Saskatchewan-Manitoba provincial boundary. Note that Fernberg's tabulated
  resistivities differ from his figures; models posted by USGS have been
  corrected to match the body of his report. [Fernberg, EPRI 2012]
