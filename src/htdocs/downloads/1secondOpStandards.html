      <b>1-Second Operational Standards for Intermagnet</b>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>
      The purpose of this letter is to help develop consensus on operational
      standards that are realistically needed for 1-second ground-based
      magnetometer systems. Several academic and governmental agencies are
      involved with the collection of 1-second data from variometer and
      observatory stations, and others are developing 1-second acquisition
      systems. Ideally, these data should be of sufficient quality to meet
      the needs of the scientific community, regardless of the particular
      system used to collect the data and regardless of the agency or
      program responsible for its collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      As many of you probably know, Intermagnet has traditionally been
      involved with the acquisition of 1-minute average data, for which it
      has a clearly defined set of operational standards. Now, Intermagnet
      needs to establish standards for 1-second acquisition. Therefore, I am
      seeking your feedback as to the standards that must be met for the user
      community. It is important to recognize that this might be, and
      generally will be, distinct from what is actually possible from an
      operational standpoint. So, for example, it might be that from a
      user's perspective, a time-stamp on each individual 1-second
      datum should have a particular accuracy, say 0.01 seconds. But
      operationally, perhaps using GPS systems, it might be possible to
      obtain a time stamp accurate to better than even 0.000001 seconds. The
      standard, then, would be set at 0.01 seconds, since that is what is
      needed, not what is possible. The objective here being that established
      standards should be based upon strict scientific necessity, avoiding
      the excessively stringent and unrealistically lofty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, I already have some opinions on these matters. But the
      purpose of this letter is to obtain some objective response from the
      community. Therefore, let me pose questions on six separate issues:
    </p>

    <p><b>Questionnaire:</b></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Data Resolution:</b> What standard should be set for data
        resolution? That is, to within at least what tolerance should the
        difference between two consecutive or nearly consecutive
        vector-component data be measured? For your information, the current
        resolution standard for Intermagnet 1-minute data is 0.1 nT. It seems
        reasonable to expect that 1-second data should meet a somewhat higher
        resolution standard. What should it be? Also, in answering this
        question, it would be extremely useful if you could also provide a
        brief example or justification for needing the stated level of
        resolution.
        <ol>
          <li>Please state your needed resolution:</li>
          <li>
            Please provide a physical reason or example illustrating or
            justifying this needed resolution:
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Data accuracy:</b> What standard should be set for data accuracy?
        That is, to within what tolerance should the absolute value of an
        individual vector component be measured? For your information,
        fully-processed 1-minute Intermagnet data are expected to represent
        the actual magnetic field of the Earth to within an absolute accuracy
        of 5 nT. The issue of accuracy for 1-second data is rarely discussed,
        and, indeed, I'm not sure that the methodologies used for attaining
        accurate 1-minute data could even be employed for 1-second data.
        Furthermore, I recognize that this might not be considered so
        important, to some user groups, as the issue of data resolution.
        If accuracy is not important to your usage, please say so. If the
        issue is important, and you can provide a specific needed standard,
        then please also provide a brief example or justification for needing
        the stated level of accuracy.
        <ol>
          <li>Please state your needed accuracy:</li>
          <li>
            Please provide a physical reason or example illustrating or
            justifying this needed accuracy:
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>General filter preferences:</b> Most acquisition systems consist
        of a mixture of analog and digital filtering steps. At the USGS we
        are designing a system which constructs 1-second average data by
        gathering multiple sub-second samples, each of which have been
        obtained after passage through an anti-aliasing Butterworth filter
        having a corner frequency of corresponding to half the sampling
        frequency. A 1-second average datum is constructed passing the
        sub-second samples through a Gaussian digital filter having a
        representative temporal width of 1-second. Of course, other filtering
        methodologies might be considered to be acceptable, and I would,
        therefore, appreciate hearing your opinion on the matter. For example,
        would single spot measurements, formed from analog filtering
        alone, be acceptable?
        <ol>
          <li>Please state your preferred filtering methodology:</li>
          <li>Please provide a brief justification for this preference:</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Time-stamp accuracy:</b> For many studies involving multiple
        acquisition stations, inter-comparison requires that the 1-second data
        have accurate time-stamps. I recognize that this issue is related,
        ultimately, to the type of filters that exist internal to the
        acquisition system and its electronics and software. Still, independent
        of practical details it is important to obtain, in the end, 1-second
        data constructed in such a way that it associated with a well-defined
        moment in time. Again, with your stated standard, please provide a
        brief example or justification as to why it is needed.
        <ol>
          <li>Please state your needed time-stamp accuracy:</li>
          <li>
            Please provide a physical reason or example illustrating or
            justifying this needed time-stamp accuracy:
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Time-stamp position:</b> For ease of usage, it would be useful to
        establish consensus on where, over the duration of a second, the
        time stamp should be applied to an individual datum constructed from
        averaging multiple sub-second samples. For your information, the
        Intermagnet standard for 1-minute data is to assign a time stamp to
        the center of a 1-minute average, with the average itself centered
        on the universal-time minute.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Assuming that reported 1-second data consist of averages of multiple
            sub-second samples, please state your preferred time-stamp position:
            <blockquote>
              ___beginning of the 1-second average, <br />
              ___center of the average, <br />
              ___end of the average:
            </blockquote>
          </li>
          <li>
            Please state your preference for position of the average:
            <blockquote>
              ___centered on the universal-time second<br />
              (so, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...), <br />
              ___centered on the universal-time half-second<br />
              (so, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 ...)
            </blockquote>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Nature of usage:</b> Finally, it would be useful if you could
        briefly summarize the general nature of your work with geomagnetic
        data and the frequency range of relevance.
        <ol>
          <li>Brief summary of your usage of 1-second data:</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <p>
    Once I have tabulated and summarized the response, I will publish the
    results on the Intermagnet and USGS websites for the purpose of public
    perusal. Results will also be presented to the leadership within
    Intermagnet for consideration of its operational standards. With this,
    then, Intermagnet will be better able to serve the scientific community in
    this important and rapidly developing area of magnetometer data acquisition.
