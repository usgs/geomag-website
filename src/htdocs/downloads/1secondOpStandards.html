	  The purpose of this letter is to help develop consensus on operational standards that are realistically needed for 1-second 
	  ground-based magnetometer systems. Several academic and governmental agencies are involved with the collection of 1-second 
	  data from variometer and observatory stations, and others are developing 1-second acquisition systems. Ideally, these data 
	  should be of sufficient quality to meet the needs of the scientific community, regardless of the particular system used to 
	  collect the data and regardless of the agency or program responsible for its collection. 
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  As many of you probably know, Intermagnet has traditionally been involved with the acquisition of 1-minute average data, 
	  for which it has a clearly defined set of operational standards. Now, Intermagnet needs to establish standards for 1-second 
	  acquisition. Therefore, I am seeking your feedback as to the standards that must be met for the user community. It is important 
	  to recognize that this might be, and generally will be, distinct from what is actually possible from an operational standpoint. 
	  So, for example, it might be that from a user’s perspective, a time-stamp on each individual 1-second datum should have a 
	  particular accuracy, say 0.01 seconds. But operationally, perhaps using GPS systems, it might be possible to obtain a time 
	  stamp accurate to better than even 0.000001 seconds. The standard, then, would be set at 0.01 seconds, since that is what is 
	  needed, not what is possible. The objective here being that established standards should be based upon strict scientific 
	  necessity, avoiding the excessively stringent and unrealistically lofty.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  Personally, I already have some opinions on these matters. But the purpose of this letter is to obtain some objective response 
	  from the community. Therefore, let me pose questions on six separate issues:
	  </p>
	  
	  <p><b>Questionnaire:</b></p>
	  
		<ol>
			<li>
			<b>Data Resolution:</b> What standard should be set for data resolution? That is, to within at least what tolerance should the 
			difference between two consecutive or nearly consecutive vector-component data be measured? For your information, the current 
			resolution standard for Intermagnet 1-minute data is 0.1 nT. It seems reasonable to expect that 1-second data should meet a 
			somewhat higher resolution standard. What should it be? Also, in answering this question, it would be extremely useful if you 
			could also provide a brief example or justification for needing the stated level of resolution.
				<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Please state your needed resolution:</li>
					<li>Please provide a physical reason or example illustrating or justifying this needed resolution:</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
			<b>Data accuracy:</b> What standard should be set for data accuracy? That is, to within what tolerance should the absolute value 
			of an individual vector component be measured? For your information, fully-processed 1-minute Intermagnet data are expected to 
			represent the actual magnetic field of the Earth to within an absolute accuracy of 5 nT. The issue of accuracy for 1-second data 
			is rarely discussed, and, indeed, I’m not sure that the methodologies used for attaining accurate 1-minute data could even be 
			employed for 1-second data. Furthermore, I recognize that this might not be considered so important, to some user groups, as the 
			issue of data resolution. If accuracy is not important to your usage, please say so. If the issue is important, and you can provide 
			a specific needed standard, then please also provide a brief example or justification for needing the stated level of accuracy.
				<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Please state your needed accuracy:</li>
					<li>Please provide a physical reason or example illustrating or justifying this needed accuracy:</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
			<b>General filter preferences:</b> Most acquisition systems consist of a mixture of analog and digital filtering steps. At the 
			USGS we are designing a system which constructs 1-second average data by gathering multiple sub-second samples, each of which have 
			been obtained after passage through an anti-aliasing Butterworth filter having a corner frequency of corresponding to half the sampling 
			frequency. A 1-second average datum is constructed passing the sub-second samples through a Gaussian digital filter having a 
			representative temporal width of 1-second. Of course, other filtering methodologies might be considered to be acceptable, and I would, 
			therefore, appreciate hearing your opinion on the matter. For example, would single spot measurements, formed from analog filtering 
			alone, be acceptable?
				<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Please state your preferred filtering methodology:</li>
					<li>Please provide a brief justification for this preference:</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
			<b>Time-stamp accuracy:</b> For many studies involving multiple acquisition stations, inter-comparison requires that the 1-second data 
			have accurate time-stamps. I recognize that this issue is related, ultimately, to the type of filters that exist internal to the acquisition 
			system and its electronics and software. Still, independent of practical details it is important to obtain, in the end, 1-second data 
			constructed in such a way that it associated with a well-defined moment in time. Again, with your stated standard, please provide a 
			brief example or justification as to why it is needed.
				<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Please state your needed time-stamp accuracy:</li>
					<li>Please provide a physical reason or example illustrating or justifying this needed time-stamp accuracy:</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
			<b>Time-stamp position:</b> For ease of usage, it would be useful to establish consensus on where, over the duration of a second, the 
			time stamp should be applied to an individual datum constructed from averaging multiple sub-second samples. For your information, the 
			Intermagnet standard for 1-minute data is to assign a time stamp to the center of a 1-minute average, with the average itself centered 
			on the universal-time minute.  
				<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
					Assuming that reported 1-second data consist of averages of multiple sub-second samples, please state your preferred time-stamp position: 
						<blockquote>
							___beginning of the 1-second average, <br />
							___center of the average, <br />
							___end of the average:
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
					Please state your preference for position of the average: 
						<blockquote>
							___centered on the universal-time second <br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(so, 0, 1, 2, 3 …), <br />
							___centered on the universal-time half-second <br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(so, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 …)
						</blockquote>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
			<b>Nature of usage:</b> Finally, it would be useful if you could briefly summarize the general nature of 
			your work with geomagnetic data and the frequency range of relevance.
				<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Brief summary of your usage of 1-second data:</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>
		Once I have tabulated and summarized the response, I will publish the results on the Intermagnet and USGS websites 
		for the purpose of public perusal. Results will also be presented to the leadership within Intermagnet for consideration 
		of its operational standards. With this, then, Intermagnet will be better able to serve the scientific community in this 
		important and rapidly developing area of magnetometer data acquisition.
		</p>
