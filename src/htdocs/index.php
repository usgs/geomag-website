        <a href="/storm/storm23.php">Event: 2015-06-23</a>
      </h3>
      <h4>Maximum Dst Amplitude -195 <abbr title="Nanotesla">nT</abbr></h4>
      <p>
        A “severe” storm occurred on June 21-23, 2015. This storm arose in response
        to variable solar-wind conditions that the Space Weather Prediction Center
        of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (SWPC, NOAA)
        associated with active region 2371 on the Sun. A series of 3 coronal mass
        ejections (CMEs) originated from this active region. These were subsequently
        recorded by NASA’s Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite, located on
        the Sun-Earth line at a distance approximately 1% of the distance from the
        Earth to the Sun, as abrupt enhancements in solar-wind velocity and density.
        With the arrival of the CMEs at the Earth on about June 21 16:45 UT,
        June 22 05:45 UT, and June 22 18:30 UT, concomitant increases in solar-wind
        ram pressure abruptly compressed the Earth’s magnetosphere. These generated
        eastward-flowing magnetopause electric currents and positive perturbations
        in the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field recorded at
        low-latitude magnetic observatories around the world, including at USGS
        observatories in Guam, Honolulu, and San Juan.
