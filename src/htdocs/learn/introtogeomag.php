  Geomagnetism is the study of the Earth's magnetic field. This includes the
  fields produced by the Earth as well as those interacting with the Earth.
  Internal dynamo processes within the Earth create slowly changing magnetic
  fields. The continuous flow of particles and fields from the Sun (called the
  solar wind) interacts with the Earth's magnetic field. Strong, transient
  impulses due to solar events produce ground-level magnetic disturbance, by
  affecting the complex current systems in and near the Earth's atmosphere. This
  means that the magnetic field on the Earth's surface is different from
  location to location, and that it changes over time. Some of these changes are
  slow, such as the centuries-long drift in the direction of the magnetic field;
  some of these changes are quick, such as the sudden enhancement during a
  geomagnetic storm that can occur in minutes.

  The use of geomagnetism for navigation began with the use of compasses for
  orientation. A compass is a simple magnetic instrument that points to magnetic
  north. Magnetic north is skewed from geographic north by an angle called
  declination. To navigate accurately, it is necessary to understand how
  declination varies over distance and time. This is why there is a long history
  of compiling magnetic information and maps. This information is still
  important today because magnetic field variations, like those seen during a
  geomagnetic storm, can affect GPS, directional drilling, electric power grids
  and other systems.

  Magnetic observatories were first established in the 19th century through the
  influence of Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Since then,
  magnetic measurement has advanced significantly, progressing from simple
  visual readings using magnetic survey instruments to automatic electronic
  recording. Modern observatories provide very accurate long-term measurements
  of the ground-level magnetic field every second. There are two ways to look at
  this data. Both of them measure F as the total magnitude of the magnetic
  field.

<h3>The first is with geographic coordinates:</h3>

<ul class="no-style">
  <li>
    X - North component. The magnitude of the magnetic field in the northern
    direction.
  </li>
  <li>
    Y - East component. The magnitude of the magnetic field in the east
    direction.
  </li>
  <li>
    Z - Downward component. The magnitude of the magnetic field toward the
    ground.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The second is with relative coordinates:</h3>

<ul class="no-style">
  <li>
    H - Horizontal intensity. The magnitude of the magnetic field parallel to
    the ground.
  </li>
  <li>
    D - Declination angle. The angle between geographic north and magnetic
    north.
  </li>
  <li>
    I - Inclination angle. The angle between the vertical direction and F.
  </li>
</ul>
