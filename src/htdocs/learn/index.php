      For centuries, navigators of the world's oceans have been familiar with an
      effect of Earth's magnetic field: It imparts a directional preference to the
      needle of a compass. Although in some settings magnetic orientation remains
      important, the modern science of geomagnetism has emerged from its romantic
      nautical origins and developed into a subject of great depth and diversity.
      The geomagnetic field is used to explore the dynamics of Earth's interior
      and its surrounding space environment, and geomagnetic data are used for
      geophysical mapping, mineral exploration, risk mitigation, and other
      practical applications. A global distribution of groundbased magnetic
      observatories supports those pursuits by providing accurate records of the
      magnetic-field direction and intensity at fixed locations and over long
      periods of time.
